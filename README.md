## Powering the Device

Plug in a USB charger to the micro USB socket on the device. It should be capable of 5 volts and at least 200 milliamps. Once connected to power the LED at the end of the tether will light up.

## Configuring the Device

There are 6 possible blink rate values, and 4 possible brightness values.

To change the brightness, press the button farthest from the USB connector, which will increase the brightness setting one position, and show it on the LED.

To change the rate the LED blinks, press the button nearest the USB connector, which will increase the rate one position,

and show it on the LED, with brighter meaning faster.

Holding a button for about half a second will have the corresponding setting start cycling through possible values, with the LED responding accordingly.
